#About Blocks!

Blocks! is a collection of small, stand-alone UI-components and HTML-patterns.

A block-component must live up to the following *demands:*

- Is there a mixin for the component with a default theme-map?
- Is GTM/tracking enabled and verified through GTM's Preview/Debug-panel?
- If it contains JavaScript, is it verified on jshint.com?
- Is there proper jsDoc-syntax for JavaScript?
- Is there proper sassDOC-syntax for the mixin, maps and variables?
- Is there a readme.md with basic instructions on how-to-use?
